Hello! My name is Colin Buyck and I am a 4th year computer science student at the University of Virginia. I am passionate about the ways that technology can empower social causes and uplift folks with marginalized identities. 

This passion has driven my development of numerous projects including websites that expedite criminal record expungement, web apps that help scale the reach of a large food bank's delivery services, and mobile apps that help prevent overcrowding during the current pandemic. 

Equipped with extensive technical coursework and hands-on experience, I am excited to continue developing technology with a focus on community needs.

Current Experience:
- Focused on Typescript and React Development
- Proficient in C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, SQL
- Familiar with R, x86 Assembly
