I am passionate about the ways that technology can empower social causes and uplift folks with marginalized identities. 

This passion has driven my development of centralized affordable housing platforms with one million unique visitors, web apps that help scale the reach of the country's largest food bank, and mobile apps that help prevented overcrowding during the pandemic. 

All through a lens of accessibility, I am eager to continue coding for the margins.

Current Experience:
- Specialized in Typescript and React Development
- Proficient in C++, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, SQL
- Familiar with R, x86 Assembly
